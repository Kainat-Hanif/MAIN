//Given the integer N â€“ the number of minutes that is passed since midnight - how many hours and minutes are displayed on the 24h digital clock?
//The program should print two numbers: the number of hours (between 0 and 23) and the number of minutes (between 0 and 59).
//For example, if N = 150, then 150 minutes have passed since midnight - i.e. now is 2:30 am. So the program should print 2 30.

         int N = s.nextInt();
        
    // Calculating the hours and minutes
              hours = (N / 60) % 24;           // Get hours within 0-23 range
              minutes = N % 60;               // Get minutes within 0-59 range
